; arrivals.php
; ============
; The page is refreshed every 'refresh' seconds.  The script queries the TfL DataPoint API
; for arrivals information for a stop identified by a 'StopID'.  A filter may be applied to the
; results using either the 'towards', 'direction' or 'route' fields (in that order).  The 
; 'route' is only really useful for bus stops which are served by more than one route number
; (called the 'lineId' in the API). You can filter using a regexp if you are interested in more than
; one bus route.  The 'direction' is useful for tram stops where you don't care about the destination
; of the trams, only which direction they are going ('inbound' or 'outbound').  The 'towards' field is
; most useful for tram stops where you are only interested in trams to a specific destination.
;
; To use the Unified API you need to obtain an app ID and key.

; departures.php
; ==============
; The page is refreshed every 'refresh' seconds. It queries the National Rail Darwin service for
; information on services between 'from' and 'to', querying for the departure times at 'from'
; and the arrival times at 'to', limiting itself to the next 'services' services in each case.
;
; To use the Darwin service you need an OpenLDBWS key.

; weather.php
; ===========
; The page is refreshed every 'refresh' seconds. OpenWeatherMap is queried for the current observations
; by ID ('owmid'). The Met Office DataPoint API is queried for the five day forecast by ID ('cityid') and the
; regional text forecast by the region ID ('regionid').
;
; Both OpenWeatherMap and the Met Office DataPoint API require a key.
